To evaluate the segmentation score, non-deterministic search by mean of
simulated anealing has been used. In the oroginal implementation the interaction
between segments has been ignored based on the assumption that there is no information in a such short text to be extracted.
Here we propose the Markov transition matric as an interaction between segments to evaluate the free energy more accurately.
